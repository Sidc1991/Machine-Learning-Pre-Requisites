## Probability

Joseph Blitzstein's [Stat 110](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home) is a fantastic course to get a handle on probability distributions. Also an extremely intuitive story telling approach to statistics that I haven't seen in other courses. [Edx](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-probability-0) version is available incase a certificate is needed.

Also worth checking out Blitzstein's talk on the soul of statistics for some added learning motivation:
