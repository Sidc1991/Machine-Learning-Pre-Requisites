# Machine Learning Pre-Requisites

A compilation of mathematics and programming pre-requisites I used to dive into ML.

## (I) Mathematics

## Calculus

[Full Introductory Calculus Course - Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-all-old)

[Multivariable Calculus - Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)

## Probability

Joseph Blitzstein's [Stat 110](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home) is a fantastic course to get a handle on probability distributions. Also an extremely intuitive story telling approach to statistics that I haven't seen in other courses. [Edx](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-probability-0) version is available incase a certificate is needed.

Also worth checking out Blitzstein's talk on the soul of statistics for some added learning motivation:

[![Soul of Statistics](https://img.youtube.com/vi/dzFf3r1yph8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzFf3r1yph8)

For a more focused introduction to **Bayesian statistics** look at Ben Lambert's course: [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwJRxp3blEvZ8AKMXOy0fc0cqT61GsKCG)

## Linear Algebra

Most linear algebra needed for ML is covered by Gilbert Strang. The pdf of his book has been uploaded in this repository and the course website can be found on [MIT.](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/) Video lectures are also available on the course website.

## Time Series

Ben Lambert has an excellent primer for time-series analysis [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvo9ZnEQG5oXC-cg8ecXr6SJZWprEL1UC). Auto-regressive models, random walks, seasonality and integrated processes which generally form the baseline of time-series analysis are given a thorough treatment. 


## Statistical Learning

The Elements of Statistical Learning pdf by Hastie and Tibshirani is uploaded in this repository. Quite easily the most accessible book written on this topic. A video course is also available on Stanford [website](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesScience/StatLearning/Winter2014/about) and on [youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOg0ngHtcqbPTlZzRHA2ocQZqB1D_qZ5V)

## Optimization

A more advanced mathematical topic. Numerical optimization underpins most of the algorithms try to solve the cost function problem in ML. This repository contains book on Numerical Optimization by Nocedal and wright. It is also worth checking Stephen Boyd's excellent Stanford course on [convex optimization.](http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/)

The youtube playlist for this course can be found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3940DD956CDF0622)

## (II) Programming Courses

## Intro to Computer Science
There are many excellent introductory computer science courses out there like Harvard CS50. However, from ML perspective, Udacity's [CS101](https://in.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--udcs101-india) has been my favourite intro to CS course with its emphasis on Python programming. 

## C++

## Pandas
Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. I have uploaded my workbook in this repository and an excellent pandas tutorial by Data School can be found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5ICCsgW1MxlZ0Hq8LL5U3u9y)

Data School's channel is also the place to look for tutorials on other useful python libraries like scikit learn and numpy.

## Latex
I prefer to use [Sharelatex's](https://www.sharelatex.com/) online latex editor to compile research documents. A good understanding of sharelatex's functionalities can be obtained from their official youtube playlist [here.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCRFsOKSM7ePUBOfh3O-K5XZldM5uCPwk)

## Git
Git is necessary for decentralized version control. A key element of any collaborative workflow. It is best to understand it through the command line as GUIs may not have all the functionalities. An excellent introduction in Git commands can be found in Corey Schafer's course: [here.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTuRUfjRe54Eea17-YfnOOAx)

## (III) Research and Miscellaneous Resources
Some additional resources to stay up-to-date with ML research.
## Youtube Channels:
Siraj Raval's [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A) and [github](https://github.com/llSourcell)

[Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/user/keeroyz)

[Arxiv Insights](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNIkB2IeJ-6AmZv7bQ1oBYg)

## Insights

Pedro Domingues's paper, *A Few Useful Things To Know About Machine Learning* uploaded in this repository is a very good intuitive introduction to what machine learning can and cannot do.
