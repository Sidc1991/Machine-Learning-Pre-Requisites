## Probability

Joseph Blitzstein's [Stat 110](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home) is a fantastic course to get a handle on probability distributions. Also an extremely intuitive story telling approach to statistics that I haven't seen in other courses. [Edx](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-probability-0) version is available incase a certificate is needed.

Also worth checking out Blitzstein's talk on the soul of statistics for some added learning motivation:

For a more focused introduction to **Bayesian statistics** look at Ben Lambert's course: [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwJRxp3blEvZ8AKMXOy0fc0cqT61GsKCG)

## Linear Algebra

Most linear algebra needed for ML is covered by Gilbert Strang. The pdf of his book has been uploaded here and the course website can be found on [MIT.](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/) Video lectures are also available on the course website.

## Time Series

Ben Lambert has an excellent primer for time-series analysis [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvo9ZnEQG5oXC-cg8ecXr6SJZWprEL1UC). Auto-regressive models, random walks, seasonality and integrated processes which generally form the baseline of time-series analysis are given a thorough treatment.
