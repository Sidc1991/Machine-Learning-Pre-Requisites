# Machine Learning Pre-Requisites

A compilation of mathematics and programming pre-requisites to dive into ML.

## (I) Mathematics

## Calculus

[Full Introductory Calculus Course - Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-all-old)

[Multivariable Calculus - Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)

## Probability

Joseph Blitzstein's [Stat 110](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home) is a fantastic course to get a handle on probability distributions. Also an extremely intuitive story telling approach to statistics that I haven't seen in other courses. [Edx](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-probability-0) version is available incase a certificate is needed.

Also worth checking out Blitzstein's talk on the soul of statistics for some added learning motivation:

For a more focused introduction to **Bayesian statistics** look at Ben Lambert's course: [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwJRxp3blEvZ8AKMXOy0fc0cqT61GsKCG)

## Linear Algebra

Most linear algebra needed for ML is covered by Gilbert Strang. The pdf of his book has been uploaded here and the course website can be found on [MIT.](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/) Video lectures are also available on the course website.

## Time Series

Ben Lambert has an excellent primer for time-series analysis [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvo9ZnEQG5oXC-cg8ecXr6SJZWprEL1UC). Auto-regressive models, random walks, seasonality and integrated processes which generally form the baseline of time-series analysis are given a thorough treatment. 


## Statistical Learning

The Elements of Statistical Learning pdf by Hastie and Tibshirani is uploaded in this repository. Quite easily the most accessible book written on this topic. A video course is also available on Stanford [website](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesScience/StatLearning/Winter2014/about) and on [youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOg0ngHtcqbPTlZzRHA2ocQZqB1D_qZ5V)

## Optimization

#==============================================

## (II) Programming Courses

## Intro to Computer Science

## C++

## Pandas

## Latex

## Git
Git is necessary for decentralized version control. A key element of any collaborative workflow. It is best to understand it through the command line as GUIs may not have all the functionalities. An excellent introduction in Git commands can be found in Corey Schafer's course: [here.]()
